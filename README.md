## Hyper Light Drifter - Autodasher
This is a tool that automates chain dashing in the game Hyper Light Drifter to unlock the relevant achievements with no effort.

Compile for Windows or download the latest release, run the game, stand on the recharge mat in the dashing room, and press Insert. Be sure to keep the game window focused as it uses Windows keyboard events to send input to the game window.

The timings have only been tested for 60 fps. If you must use 30 fps, you may need to tweak the Sleep() timings on lines 58 and 60.
